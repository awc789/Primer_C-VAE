## SARS-CoV-2 virus Gene Sequence Data

## Dataset:
- GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/)
- NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
- ~~NGDC (https://big.ac.cn/ncov/?lang=en)~~

The detail of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence data used in this project can be seen in the following file:

**`SARS_CoV_2_Gene_sequence_info.md`**

#### Overall
- ##### For SARS-CoV-2 virus (Homo Sapiens Host):
    - The gene sequence data files downloaded from the **GISAID** database. If the classification of the variant virus has been completed, please move them to **`./Dataset/Variant_virus`** with correct variant types. Or please using the [Pangolin](https://cov-lineages.org/resources/pangolin.html) to make sure which type of variants that the gene sequence belongs to and then move to **`./Dataset/Variant_virus`** with correct variant types.
    - The gene sequence data files downloaded from the **NCBI** database need to use [Pangolin](https://cov-lineages.org/resources/pangolin.html) to make sure which type of variants that the gene sequence belongs to and then move to **`./Dataset/Variant_virus`** with correct variant types.
- ##### For SARS-CoV-2 virus (Non-Homo Sapiens Host):  
    -  Please move files to **`./Dataset/other_virus/other_virus_seq`**
- ##### For other taxa (Homo Sapiens Host):
    -  Please move files to **`./Dataset/other_virus/other_virus_seq`**

ATTENTION: 

- The GISAID Dataset requires registration and login to download the gene sequnence data.
- The NCBI Dataset will not provide classification of virus variants. If needs to download the data from NCBI Dataset, it will need to use [Pangolin](https://cov-lineages.org/resources/pangolin.html) to implement the dynamic nomenclature of SARS-CoV-2 lineages.
- The NGDC Dataset is alos a popular dataset for SARS-CoV-2 virus. But at the moment working on this project the network always shows that it cannot download the data from the NGDC Database.

After training the CNN model for Forward Primer Design, you can use the **`other_code/confusion_matrix.py`** file to generate a confusion matrix and plot the images to determine the accuracy of the model's classification results.

**There are two ways to run the codes:**
        
        1. - Recommended: Using Amazon Web Services
                - Upload data to AWS S3
                - Creat a SageMaker Notebook
                - Clone this project by using following code:
                    !git clone https://github.com/awc789/Machine-Learning-Based-Primer-Identification-for-the-Detection-of-SARS-CoV-2-Emerging-Variants.git
                - Install the required packages:
                    !pip install -r requirements.txt
                - main.ipynb
        
        2. - Running on local devices
                - Download the data from GISAID/NCBI and this project
                - Change the function 'S3_to_sageMaker' which is using for reading data
                - main.ipynb

- It is **NOT** recommended to use the **`other_code/online_validation.py`** file to complete the In-Silico PCR at the [UCSC In-Silico PCR](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPcr) website.

- Please use the [FastPCR](https://primerdigital.com/fastpcr.html) or [Unipro UGENE](http://ugene.net/) software for the In-Silico PCR to check the availability of the candidate primers.
